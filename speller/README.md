# Speller
This project is a spell checker which takes in a selected dictionary file and compares words in a selected text. 
This project utilizes a hash function to speed up the search in the dictionary. 

## Instructions:
Copy repo and run:
```console
./speller [text.txt]
```

You're more than welcome to use the texts found in the texts folder.

Included texts:
- The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [shakespear.txt]
- LaLaLand Screenplay [lalaland.txt]
- Bram Stoker's Dracula [stoker.txt]

**Custom dictionary**
```console
./speller dictionaries/[dictionary.txt] texts/[text.txt]
```

### Please note this project is from very early in my coding journey and if I were to go back, there are several choices I would reassess.
